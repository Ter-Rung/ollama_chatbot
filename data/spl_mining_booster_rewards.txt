Boosters Rewards
Why Does the SuperWAL App Require Location Access?
The SuperWAL app leverages location access to enhance the Booster feature, enabling users to maximize rewards, foster collaboration, and build a stronger community. This functionality is designed to balance effective performance with privacy and efficient device usage.

How Location Access Works and Benefits You
Boost Performance Optimization

The app updates your location every 1 minute while the app is open, allowing it to calculate the number of users within a 200-meter radius.

This ensures you can participate in Community Circle Rates, which increase your rewards based on the number of nearby participants actively mining SPL tokens.

Location tracking integrates you into an active community, maximizing your chances of earning higher rewards.

Meeting Point Functionality

Meeting points are created when a user uses the app and allows location access. Your meeting point is within 200 meters of your location.

This encourages teamwork and collaboration, enabling participants to boost collectively and amplify rewards.

The system determines optimal gathering points, ensuring all users benefit from a dynamic and interactive Booster experience.

Efficient Location Management

Real-time tracking is avoided: The app updates your location only during interactions, such as opening the app or pressing the boost button. This minimizes battery drain and data usage while maintaining functionality.

When the app is closed, your location data is retained temporarily for up to 60 minutes. After this period, your last location is automatically removed from the map.

The app clearly explains why location access is needed, ensuring you remain in control of your privacy.
