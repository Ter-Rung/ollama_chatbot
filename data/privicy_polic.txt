Welcome to SuperWAL – an open blockchain platform designed to support real-world asset tokenization, decentralized identity verification, document authentication, and true random number generation. At SuperWAL, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in how we collect, use, and share your information. This Privacy Policy explains in detail how we handle your data when you use our services, while adhering to the standards of AdMob, Google, and applicable data protection regulations.

When you create an account or use our services, you may provide details such as your email address, username, or information required for identity verification (if applicable).

Data you upload while using features like asset tokenization, document verification, or transactions on the platform.

Information Collected Automatically:

Device and Usage Data: This includes your IP address, device type, operating system, browser information, and your activities on the platform (e.g., transactions, staking, or yield farming).

Advertising ID: If you use an app version with AdMob ads, we or third-party partners (like Google) may collect your advertising ID to deliver relevant ads.

Blockchain Data: Public transactions on Walchain (SuperWAL’s Layer 1 blockchain) are recorded on a decentralized ledger, including wallet addresses and transaction details.

Information from Third Parties:

If you connect to SuperWAL via third-party services (e.g., cryptocurrency wallets or authentication platforms), we may receive information from those sources in accordance with their policies.

2. How We Collect Information

Directly from You: Through registration forms, interactions with our app, or services.

Automatically: Using technologies such as cookies, SDKs (software development kits), and analytics tools to track your activity. For example, the Google Mobile Ads SDK, used to integrate AdMob ads, may automatically collect usage data.

From Blockchain: Transaction data is publicly recorded and immutable on Walchain.

3. Purpose of Using Information

We use your information to:

Provide and Improve Services: Ensure the operation of features like staking SPL tokens, yield farming, identity verification, and asset tokenization.

Security: Prevent fraud, protect your account, and maintain the integrity of the SuperWAL ecosystem.

Legal Compliance: Fulfill legal or regulatory requirements when necessary.

4. Sharing Information with Third Parties

We may share your information in the following cases:

With Service Partners:

Blockchain Service Providers: Infrastructure or cross-chain bridge providers may process transaction data to ensure compatibility with other networks.

For Legal Requirements: If required by law or authorities, we will share necessary information after verifying the request’s legitimacy.

We do not sell your personal data to any third parties for commercial purposes.

6. Data Security

We implement technical and organizational measures to protect your data, including:
