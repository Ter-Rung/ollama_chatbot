Google Authenticator
Google Authenticator operates as an additional security safeguard for your account, functioning as a software token within a two-step verification mechanism. This mobile app generates unique passwords, even without an internet connection, utilizing a time-based algorithm. Once activated, it exhibits a randomly generated six-digit code, acting as a one-time password to bolster account security. Activating two-factor authentication (2FA) mandates the use of this distinct one-time password along with your regular password for login, heightening protection against unauthorized access.

Considering our strong focus on player security, we highly encourage the adoption of Google Authenticator. This straightforward step can preempt potential security concerns and offer users peace of mind.

Enabling Google Authenticator triggers 2FA for each login or withdrawal, and it's recommended to preserve the QR code or manual code. This information serves as a recovery aid should your mobile device be lost or damaged.
