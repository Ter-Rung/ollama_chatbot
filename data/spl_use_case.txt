SPL Use Case
1. Transactions and Payments
Description

The SPL token serves as the native currency of the Walchain ecosystem, facilitating seamless peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions and payments for goods and services. It is designed to provide a fast, cost-effective alternative to traditional financial systems, making it suitable for everyday microtransactions as well as larger transfers.

How It Works

Users can send and receive SPL tokens through the Walchain wallet, available as a web or mobile application, with an intuitive interface for both technical and non-technical users. Transactions are processed and validated by the Light Validator network, which employs a Quorum Slice consensus mechanism or Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) as a fallback to ensure security and reliability.

To enhance scalability, Walchain uses ZK-Rollups, a layer-2 scaling solution that batches hundreds or thousands of transactions into a single cryptographic proof, significantly reducing on-chain data and transaction costs. Additionally, Multi-Chain Sharding divides the network into multiple parallel chains (shards), each capable of processing transactions independently, enabling high throughput of up to 5,000 transactions per second (TPS).

For example, a user sending 50 SPL tokens to another user incurs a minimal fee of approximately 0.01 SPL, and the transaction is finalized in 2-5 seconds, thanks to the combined efficiency of sharding and rollups.

Supporting Technologies

ZK-Rollups: Compresses multiple transactions into a single proof, reducing gas fees from an estimated 0.1 SPL to 0.01 SPL, making microtransactions economically viable.

Multi-Chain Sharding: Enhances scalability by distributing transaction processing across multiple shards, preventing network congestion and ensuring consistent performance.

Quorum Slice: A trust-based consensus mechanism where validators form overlapping groups (slices) to confirm transactions, ensuring security without relying on a fixed validator set.

Light Validators: Lightweight nodes that require minimal hardware (e.g., a smartphone with a 1GHz CPU and 2GB RAM), democratizing participation in transaction validation.

Real-World Use Cases

Everyday Purchases: A user pays 20 SPL tokens to buy coffee at a café that accepts Walchain payments. The transaction is processed almost instantly, with a negligible fee, offering a user experience comparable to mobile payment apps like Venmo or PayPal.

International Remittances: A user sends 100 SPL tokens to family members abroad. Unlike traditional banking systems, which may charge high fees and take days to process, the transaction completes in seconds with a fee of just 0.01 SPL, making cross-border payments affordable and efficient.

Freelance Payments: A freelancer receives 200 SPL tokens for services rendered, with the client paying minimal fees and the transaction recorded immutably on the blockchain.

Benefits

Low Costs: Near-zero transaction fees make SPL tokens ideal for both small and large payments.

High Speed: Transactions are finalized in seconds, enabling real-time use cases.

Accessibility: The user-friendly Walchain wallet ensures that non-technical users can easily adopt the system.

Global Reach: SPL tokens enable borderless payments without intermediaries, reducing reliance on traditional financial institutions.

2. Staking for Rewards
Description

SPL tokens can be staked within the Walchain ecosystem to participate in the Light Validator network, allowing users to earn rewards in the form of additional SPL tokens. This staking mechanism incentivizes network security and provides a source of passive income for token holders.

How It Works

Users lock their SPL tokens in the LightValidatorContract via the Walchain wallet to become validators or delegate their tokens to existing validators. Light Validators are responsible for validating transactions and maintaining network integrity through the Quorum Slice consensus mechanism. The voting power of a validator is determined by two factors:

Staked SPL Amount: The more tokens staked, the greater the influence in consensus.

Reliability Metrics: Metrics such as uptime and failure rate ensure that only dependable validators are rewarded.

Rewards are distributed periodically (e.g., monthly) based on the strength of a validator’s Quorum Slice, which requires at least 66% of the network’s weight (a measure of trust and stake) to be considered valid. The use of ZK-Rollups ensures that reward distribution transactions are cost-efficient, with fees as low as 0.01 SPL.

If the Quorum Slice mechanism fails to achieve consensus (e.g., due to network partitions), the SCP Fallback ensures network liveness by allowing validators to reach agreement through an alternative consensus process.

Supporting Technologies

Quorum Slice: Ensures equitable reward distribution by requiring validators to form trusted slices with sufficient network weight, preventing large validators from dominating the system.

ZK-Rollups: Reduces the cost of claiming rewards, making staking accessible to users with smaller token holdings.

SCP Fallback: Provides a robust backup consensus mechanism to maintain network operations under adverse conditions.

LightValidatorContract: A smart contract that manages staking, reward distribution, and validator registration, designed for efficiency and transparency.

Real-World Use Cases

Passive Income for Individuals: A user stakes 100 SPL tokens for 30 days and earns 5-10 SPL tokens (a 5-10% monthly return) by running a Light Validator on a low-resource device, such as a smartphone or Raspberry Pi.

Small-Scale Validators: A user with only 10 SPL tokens stakes their tokens and collaborates with other small validators to form a trusted Quorum Slice with a combined weight of 1,500. This allows them to earn 0.04 SPL tokens monthly, ensuring that even users with modest holdings can participate.

Community Validators: A group of users pools their SPL tokens to run a shared validator node, splitting the rewards proportionally based on their contributions.

Benefits

Inclusivity: The low hardware requirements and fair reward distribution enable users with small stakes to participate as validators.

Cost Efficiency: ZK-Rollups minimize the fees associated with staking and reward claiming.

Security: The Quorum Slice mechanism ensures that only reliable validators are rewarded, enhancing network integrity.

Passive Income: Staking provides a predictable and accessible way for users to earn returns on their holdings.

3. Decentralized Governance (DAO)
Description

SPL tokens are the governance currency of the Walchain Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), empowering token holders to vote on critical network decisions, such as protocol upgrades, fee structures, and ecosystem development priorities.

How It Works

To participate in governance, users stake their SPL tokens in the DAOContract, which grants them voting rights proportional to their staked amount (1 SPL = 1 vote). Proposals, such as increasing the network’s TPS or allocating funds for ecosystem development, are submitted to the DAO and voted on by stakeholders. The Quorum Slice mechanism ensures that proposals require approval from a supermajority (at least 66% of the network’s weight) to pass, preventing manipulation by a small group of large stakeholders.

The IPFS PubSub system is used to broadcast proposals and voting results across the network in near real-time (under 0.5 seconds), ensuring transparency and accessibility. ZK-Rollups reduce the cost of submitting and processing votes, making governance participation affordable even for users with small stakes.

Supporting Technologies

Quorum Slice: Ensures fair and secure voting by requiring overlapping trust relationships among validators, preventing collusion or fraudulent voting.

IPFS PubSub: A decentralized messaging system that enables rapid dissemination of governance-related information, ensuring all participants are informed in real time.

ZK-Rollups: Compresses voting transactions to lower fees from an estimated 0.1 SPL to 0.01 SPL, encouraging widespread participation.

DAOContract: A smart contract that manages proposal submission, voting, and outcome execution, ensuring transparency and immutability.

Real-World Use Cases

Protocol Upgrades: A user stakes 50 SPL tokens to vote on a proposal to increase the network’s TPS from 5,000 to 10,000, contributing to the ecosystem’s scalability. The proposal is validated through Quorum Slice, ensuring broad consensus.

Community-Driven Initiatives: A group of small token holders, each staking 10 SPL tokens, collaborates to form a strong Quorum Slice and votes to fund a community-driven project, such as integrating Walchain with a new DeFi protocol.

Fee Structure Adjustments: Token holders vote to reduce transaction fees for specific use cases (e.g., microtransactions), making the ecosystem more competitive with centralized payment systems.

Benefits

Decentralization: Every token holder has a voice, ensuring that governance reflects the community’s collective will.

Fairness: The Quorum Slice mechanism prevents large stakeholders from dominating decisions, giving smaller holders meaningful influence.

Low Costs: ZK-Rollups make voting accessible to all users, regardless of stake size.

Transparency: IPFS PubSub and the DAOContract ensure that governance processes are open and verifiable.

4. Decentralized Data Storage with IPFS
Description

SPL tokens are used to pay for and earn rewards from decentralized data storage services integrated with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) on Walchain. This allows users to store files securely without relying on centralized servers.

How It Works

Users request file storage by paying SPL tokens through the StorageContract, which specifies the file’s Content Identifier (CID), size, and storage duration. Light Validators with available storage capacity “pin” the file on IPFS, ensuring its availability across the network. Validators earn SPL rewards if their Quorum Slice is strong enough (at least 66% of network weight) to validate the storage request.

The IPFS PubSub system notifies validators of storage requests in real-time (within 0.5 seconds), enabling rapid coordination. ZK-Rollups reduce the cost of storage-related transactions, with fees as low as 0.01 SPL, making the system economically viable for both users and validators.

Supporting Technologies

IPFS PubSub: A P2P messaging system that broadcasts storage requests and confirmations, ensuring efficient communication among validators.

StorageContract: A smart contract that manages storage requests, payments, and reward distribution, ensuring transparency and fairness.

ZK-Rollups: Lowers the cost of storage transactions, making decentralized storage competitive with centralized alternatives.

Quorum Slice: Ensures that only reliable validators with sufficient network trust earn rewards, maintaining service quality.

Real-World Use Cases

Business Document Storage: A small business pays 5 SPL tokens to store a contract on IPFS. A validator with a 1,000 SPL stake pins the file and earns 2 SPL tokens as a reward, validated through Quorum Slice.

Personal File Backup: An individual pays 1 SPL token to store 1GB of personal photos on IPFS for six months. A small validator with a 10 SPL stake provides storage capacity and earns 0.05 SPL monthly.

5. Document Verification with Decentralized Identifiers (DID)
Description

SPL tokens are used to pay for storing and verifying documents linked to Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) on Walchain, enabling secure and tamper-proof document authentication.

How It Works

Users pay SPL tokens to store a document’s SHA-256 hash and associated DID in the DocVerifyContract. A DID (e.g., did:walchain:USER1) is created through the DIDContract, which links the document to a user’s cryptographic identity (public key). The document hash ensures Light Validators verify the hash’s integrity, ensuring that the document has not been altered. The Quorum Slice mechanism ensures that verification is performed by a trusted group of validators with at least 66% of the network’s weight.

The IPFS PubSub system broadcasts verification requests to validators in under 0.5 seconds, enabling rapid processing. ZK-Rollups reduce the cost of storing and verifying documents, with fees as low as 0.01 SPL for DID creation and 0.05 SPL for document hashing.

Supporting Technologies
